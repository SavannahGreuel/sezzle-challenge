# Front End Challenge: Build a Calculator App

For this challenge, you're tasked with implementing a calculator application. Your calculator should have the following features:

1. A display that displays the calculator's current total.
2. Buttons for all the single-digit numerals.
3. A decimal button to designate floating-point numbers. 
4. `+`, `-`, `x`, `รท`, and `=` buttons for each respective operation.
5. A `+/-` button to toggle between positive and negative values.
6. A `%` for the modulo operation. 
7. An `AC` button to clear the state of the calculator and reset the starting value to 0. 

Once you've gotten all of the functionality working, you can start to worry about styling. 

## Hints

Feel free to implement this application with a combination of React and Redux, or in React. Implementing this application in pure React is a bit trickier, but entirely possible. 

Additionally, you may want to use a library like [big.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/big.js/) for performing decimal arithmetic in JavaScript.
